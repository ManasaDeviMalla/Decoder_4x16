# Decoder_4x16

Decoder is a combinational circuit that has ‘n‘ input lines and maximum of 2n output lines. One of these outputs will be active High based on the combination of inputs present, when the decoder is enabled. It means that Decoder detect a particular code. The output of the decoder are nothing but the min terms of ‘n‘ input variables (lines), when it is enabled.

A decoder is a combinational circuit which has many inputs and many outputs. It is used to convert binary data to other codes. Examples: binary to octal conversion using 3 to 8 decoder, BCD to decimal conversion using 4 to 10 decoder, binary to hexadecimal conversion using 4 to 16 decoder, etc.
